# My health pass 
Solution to the Medullan coding exercise. 
-	The module was built in Nodejs and uses a MongoDB instance to store information. Also, the module returns a JSON Web Token to handle session.
-	The software has a single-entry point in a file called: app.js. You can find this file at the root of the project.
-	To use the module its necessary to import the app.js file to your project.
-	The module was developed using TDD concept. 10 tests were made to check the whole software behavior.

### How to use:
1. Copy the whole project in your working set.
2. Execute npm install to download the necesary software libraries.
3. Include in your implementation the file app.js. This file is the entry point for the system functionality.
4. I've included a small Client and Server functionality to test the module. To use the client/server you need to:
    - Clone the project.
    - Execute: npm install.
    - Copy the content of frontend/build to your web server.
    - The express backend uses the port 40001, check that the port is available.
    - npm start.
